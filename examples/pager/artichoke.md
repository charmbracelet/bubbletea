## Let’s talk about artichokes

The _artichoke_ is mentioned as a garden plant in the 8th century BC by Homer **and** Hesiod. The naturally occurring variant of the artichoke, the cardoon, which is native to the Mediterranean area, also has records of use as a food among the ancient Greeks and Romans. Pliny the Elder mentioned growing of _carduus_ in Carthage and Cordoba.

> He holds him with a skinny hand,
> ‘There was a ship,’ quoth he.
> ‘Hold off! unhand me, grey-beard loon!’
> An artichoke, dropt he.

--Samuel Taylor Coleridge, [The Rime of the Ancient Mariner][rime]

## Currying Artichokes

Here’s a bit of code in [Haskell](https://haskell.org), because we are fancy. Remember that to compile Haskell you’ll need `ghc`.

```haskell
module Main where

import Data.Function ( (&) )
import Data.List ( intercalculate )

hello :: String -> String
hello s =
    "Hello, " ++ s ++ "."

main :: IO ()
main =
    map hello [ "artichoke", "alcachofa" ] & intercalculate "\n" & putStrLn
```

_Alcachofa_, if you were wondering, is artichoke in Spanish.
